<h1 style="text-align:center;color:white;font-size:400%">Features of  Electronic Health Record<h1/>
<br>
<h1 style="text-align:left;color:white;font-size:160%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Comprehensive patient charts and records
<h1 style="text-align:left;color:white;font-size:120%"><br> All EHR software will include a comprehensive record of a patient’s health history across the entire healthcare system. This includes patient diagnoses, lab test results, medications, allergies, and much more. Conveniently, all this information is streamlined into one electronic platform. Many types of EHR software also allow physicians to create customizable templates for each patient within the system. This can facilitate personalized note-taking during particular patient appointments.
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="text-align:left;color:white;font-size:160%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Prescription and test management
<h1 style="text-align:left;color:white;font-size:120%"><br> All EHR software will include a comprehensive record of a patient’s health history across the entire healthcare system. This includes patient diagnoses, lab test results, medications, allergies, and much more. Conveniently, all this information is streamlined into one electronic platform. Many types of EHR software also allow physicians to create customizable templates for each patient within the system. This can facilitate personalized note-taking during particular patient appointments.
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="text-align:left;color:white;font-size:160%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Patient portal
<h1 style="text-align:left;color:white;font-size:120%"><br> Good EHR software includes patient portals, which allows patients access to their own health records in addition to other helpful tools. Many patient portals allow patients to view things such as reports about their health history, population health reports, and other educational tools so that patients can take control over their own health. Patient portals often also allow online scheduling, summaries of recent visits, and other helpful points of information.
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="text-align:left;color:white;font-size:160%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;4. E-prescription tool
<h1 style="text-align:left;color:white;font-size:120%"><br> EHR software often has an e-prescribing tool, which allows physicians to order and manage prescriptions electronically using their software. This makes both physicians’ and patients’ lives easier, as it eliminates the need for paper prescriptions. The doctor will send a prescription electronically to the patient’s pharmacy, and the patient no longer has to carry around a paper prescription script.
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="text-align:left;color:white;font-size:160%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;5. Physician decision support
<h1 style="text-align:left;color:white;font-size:120%"><br> Many EHR software has built-in “decision support” tools. These tools are designed to help physicians make smarter decisions about their patients’ health based on “best practices” as well as the patient’s health history and specific health information. This leads to safer and higher quality healthcare for each patient. For instance, there is “medication decision support,” which helps physicians choose the right medication for each patient based on their history and needs. 
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="text-align:left;color:white;font-size:160%"> &nbsp;&nbsp;6. Integrations
<h1 style="text-align:left;color:white;font-size:120%"><br> It’s helpful to know that EHR software can often be integrated with other necessary back-end healthcare systems. In fact, many types of software have EHR built-in so medical offices can streamline their points of information and run their practices more efficiently.
